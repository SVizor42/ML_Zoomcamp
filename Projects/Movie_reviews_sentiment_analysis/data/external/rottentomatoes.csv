review
Though at times predictable and drawn-out, Matthias Schweigh?fer's Army of Thieves is a clever, offbeat heist flick that more than stands on its own two feet as a prequel to Army of the Dead.
The film ends up feeling largely devoid of personality.
Halloween tries to cram too much into a single film and doesn't do any of it justice. The film loses focus whenever it isn't dedicated to the Strodes and Dr Sartain is one of the worst characters in modern horror.
[Forgets] that a decent Halloween movie should take its cue from Michael Myers: low on chat, high on surprise. Even so, this one can still boast a higher-than-average proportion of treats among its tricks.
The abundance of humor and action help to mask all the underlying themes that can be construed as far too adult or mature for the family-friendly layout.
